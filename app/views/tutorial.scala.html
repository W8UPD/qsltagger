    <h2>Welcome to QSLTagger.</h2>

    <p>
      You've successfully authenticated and can begin tagging cards right away.
      You can return to this page any time by clicking "tutorial" in the user
      menu, at the top of any page.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you know what you're doing, feel free to go to <a href="/">the home
      page</a> and begin your QSL card tagging adventure. Otherwise, read up
      below. It's easy to get started.
    </p>

    <h2>How does tagging work?</h2>
    <p>
      When you are ready to begin tagging, you'll be presented with a random QSL
      card. You'll be shown all sides of the card, and asked to type information
      relating to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some things you should tag are <i>callsign</i>, <i>location</i>, <i>time
      and date</i> of the contact, <i>signal reports</i>, and any other
      information that could help people <b>search</b>. The information that you
      input will be used to create a searchable index, which will let people
      easily query our database to find matching QSL cards, given a set of
      searchable criteria.
    </p>

    <h2>So how do I do it?</h2>
    <p>
      Well, go to the home page. You'll be presented with a random QSL card, for
      you to tag. To get started, click and drag over an area of the card that
      you wish to tag. For example, draw a box over the callsign that appears
      on a card. A modal dialog will come up, and give you options, which will
      allow you to tag that piece of information appropriately.
    </p>
